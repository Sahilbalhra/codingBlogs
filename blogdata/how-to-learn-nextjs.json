React documentation mentions Next.js among Recommended Toolchains advising it to developers as a solution when 'Building a server-rendered website with Node.js'.[4] Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side. The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by company Vercel, which also maintains and leads its open-source development.[5]",
